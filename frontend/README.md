# Front end for Altinn 3 Authorization

## Getting started üöÄ

To get a full development environment with front and back end, check the [README file](../README.md) for the whole repo (basically, run `docker compose up`).

To run or build the front end standalone (without Docker), you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). Simply run `yarn` to install dependencies and then `yarn dev` to start the development environment.

(If you switch between the Docker-based and local development environments, always run `yarn` before `yarn dev` to ensure the dependencies are correct for your local environment.)

## Project organisation üß©

This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)-based single-page app using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The main entry point is `/src/index.tsx`. You'll find React components under `/src/components/`, while code that deals with non-rendering functionality is in `/src/services/` or `/src/utils/` (only very simple stuff in the latter).

The basic file structure for components should be:

```
components\
  ComponentName\
    - ComponentName.tsx
    - ComponentName.test.tsx (unit tests)
    - index.ts (public interface for the component)
    - style.css (if needed)
    - SubComponent1.tsx (if needed)
    - SubComponent2.tsx (if needed)
```

ü™Ñ You can run `yarn nc ComponentName` to create a new "ComponentName" component boilerplate like above.

## Coding conventions üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### TypeScript

Use [PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) for both component and file names. We use ESLint with Prettier rules ‚Äî you might want to add an ESLint plugin to your editor.

### CSS

Use [BEM naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/) ‚Äî this gives a pretty clear view of what parts are the "root" and what parts are the "children". This also helps you think about when a component grows too big, and should be split into smaller isolated parts.

Scalar values (sizes, colours‚Ä¶) should usually be references to design tokens exposed as CSS variables by the [Altinn Design System](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-design-system). For example:

```css
.componentName {
  border: var(--border_width-standard) solid var(--color-success-calm);
  display: flex;
  padding: var(--space-base);
}
```

## Tests üß®

Run `yarn test` to run [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) in watch mode.

Run `yarn coverage` to see pretty test coverage stats (interactive results get placed in the `coverage/` folder).

## Configuration ‚úÖ

At startup `services/config.ts` will pick up configuration from three possible sources, in order of priority:

- environment variables (these become static during the build)
- JSON embedded in a `<script>` tag with the correct ID, e.g.:

  ```html
  <script type="application/json" id="altinn3-app-config">
    {
      "backendApiUrl": "http://localhost:5117/api/"
    }
  </script>
  ```

- Hard-coded defaults

Use `getConfig()` to retrieve configuration at runtime. Currently configurable settings (please keep this list up to date):

| Env variable         | JSON          | Default                | Purpose                   |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| VITE_BACKEND_API_URL | backendApiUrl | current host + '/api/' | Base URL for BE API calls |
| VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE  | defaultLocale | 'no'                   | Fallback locale           |

## Building and deploying üöö

To create a distributable bundle, run `yarn build`. Environment variables set at build time will be baked into the bundle (e.g. `VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en yarn build`). See the resulting `dist/index.html` for an example on how to load the build.

If the bundled files are to be served from a path other than the server root, you must pass the `--base=/path/to/folder/` argument to `yarn build`. The trailing slash is important.

## Migration plan üöß

This project aims to be a Single Page App (SPA) for the whole Profile page in the Altinn portal. Until it achieves that state, this app integrates into a larger Razor-template-driven page, rendered by the back end.

The idea is to migrate feature-by-feature parts of the page to the SPA, allowing continuous development of those features. This avoids a large "big bang" rewrite that migrates all features at once ‚Äî that would prevent ongoing feature development until complete, or would require such work to be done in two codebases simultaneously (old and new).

### Method

The features managed by this app behave like a normal SPA, using `react-router`'s `<Link>` component for internal navigation. Features on the page still handled by the Razor back end use the standard request/response navigation of a Multi Page App (MPA), and non-React JavaScript that manipulates the DOM.

Given the mixed management of the DOM (React/Razor), this SPA makes use of [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) to maintain a single React VDOM tree.

The React DOM can be injected in disparate parts of the document by using `<div>` tags output by Razor with an appropriate ID for each feature ‚Äî¬†these serve as anchors for that part of the React-managed DOM. On initialisation of React, each feature's base component in injected into the appropriate anchor `<div>` via a React Portal.

```html
<!-- Razor template -->
<p>This is output by Razor</p>
<div id="altinn3-feature-x-root"></div>
<p>This is output by Razor</p>
<div id="altinn3-feature-y-root"></div>
<p>This is output by Razor</p>
```

```jsx
const featureXRoot = document.getElementById('altinn3-feature-x-root');
const featureYRoot = document.getElementById('altinn3-feature-y-root');

reactRoot.render(
  <>
    {featureXRoot && ReactDOM.createPortal(<FeatureX />, featureXRoot)}
    {featureYRoot && ReactDOM.createPortal(<FeatureY />, featureYRoot)}
  </>
);
```

The root of the React application itself is just another empty `<div>` on the page (created automatically on initialisation).

See `src/index.tsx` for the initialisation code.

### Objective

Once all features are migrated away from Razor, the SPA should manage the full DOM driven by `react-router` routing and the application's internal state ‚Äî in short, a standard SPA architecture.

The Portals used during the transition period should then be removed and each feature base component should render directly within the React root.

```jsx
reactRoot.render(
  <>  
    <FeatureX />
    <FeatureY />
  </>
);
```
